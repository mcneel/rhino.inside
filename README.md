* Starting Rhino and Grasshopper as an add in another product.
* Call directly into the host's native APIs from a Grasshopper or Rhino plugin.
* Access Rhino's APIs through the host application.
* Grasshopper definitions can be opened and previewed in Rhino within the same process as the parent.
* Object can be natively created by Rhino or Grasshopper within the parent product.
